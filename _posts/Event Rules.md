- The venue is over two floors with no lift.
- On the ground floor there is a large dungeon with three main areas: medical, old fashioned office/study, and a four poster bed. There is an all gender toilet on this floor (not for piss play), which has step free access but is not wheelchair accessible.
- The second floor is reached by a quite narrow and steep staircase and has a wide range of play furniture including St Andrews cross, cage, benches, turntable, pulleys. There is a small changing area, kitchen and all gender toilet on this floor (also not for piss play).
- Lighting will be mixed low and medium level.
- There will be background music.

Respect
- In line with the Proteus code of conduct {https://proteusleather.club/coc/}, no forms of abuse, bullying, or harassment will be tolerated. This includes racism, sexism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, biphobia, whorephobia, fatphobia, ableism, classism and ageism and other forms of oppression, and we will ask folks who behave in these ways to leave.
- Proteus respects everyone’s right to self-define, and nobody’s identity will be subject to scrutiny or debate. Failure to abide by this will result in your removal from the venue, and may result in the removal of membership status.
- If you feel someone is behaving inappropriately or unsafely then come to an organiser wearing a lanyard.

Consent
- This is an event where people from different queer cultures will come together, and people may navigate consent differently. We ask people to be mindful of this, and encourage you to navigate consent with playpartners on an individual basis.
- When cruising, no means no.
- The party safeword is RED and means **stop the scene**.
- Proteus takes a zero tolerance stance to consent violation.
- Please immediately inform an organiser if you have reason to suspect that someone’s consent or safeword is not being honoured. Organisers on duty will be clearly identifiable by lanyards.


Discretion
- Keep the details of what happens at Eros & Agony private. This means not sharing details of who you see here, who you play with, or what goes on, outside the party.
- **No phones or photography** in the play areas at all, unless by agreement with organisers and anyone in the shot.
- Anyone found taking photos without permission will be asked to leave.

  

Play
- **Play NOT permitted:** scat, piss, fire, and wax play.
- Blood/sharps/needle play is permitted but must be kept to the curtained area at the back of the ground floor. If you will be drawing or otherwise playing with blood, please:
	- bring an appropriate sharps bin with you;
	- ensure you have covered all surfaces appropriately and take measures to avoid contamination;
	- clean up properly after yourself! Use the provided disinfectant spray on any surfaces or equipment that sweat and other body fluids have come into contact with, and clean up any litter you have created.

  

Safer Sex

- Sex is permitted at this venue.
- We encourage safer sex.
- Gloves, condoms and lube will be provided but we recommend that you bring your own supplies.
- Clean up properly after yourself! Use the provided disinfectant spray on any surfaces or equipment that sweat and other body fluids have come into contact with, and clean up any litter you have created.

  

Food
- Simple snacks (incl. vegan and gluten free) and some soft drinks will be provided.
- You are welcome to bring your own food **(cold only)** and drinks but please keep them separate to protect those with allergies.

  

Intoxication

Smoking

- No drinks allowed outside.
- Clear up any cigarette or cigar butts.


Sharing Space
- Please share the play spaces and venue equipment considerately and clean up after your scene.
- Keep negotiation and aftercare to non-play spaces, so the play equipment can get as much use as possible.
- Don’t interrupt or disturb scenes/play/aftercare unless it is urgent and necessary. If you really need to ask players a practical question (eg. if it is ok that you play close to them), wait for the right moment and keep it short.
- Keep casual chat to the non-play areas near the entrance, and in the kitchen, and dressing room.
- Do not comment on play, unless you have been invited to do so by the players.

Being asked to leave
- We reserve the right to remove someone without explanation.
- Examples of behaviour that might warrant this include (but are not limited to) being non-consensually aggressive to other attendees or organisers, being intoxicated, behaving in a way that disregards consent, making repeated unwanted advances on someone, non- consensually participating in a scene, and so on.
