- To create a space which prioritizes leatherfolk of trans experience, and enables them to discuss and explore their fetish in an environment free from cissexism and transphobia
- To encourage members to live by the values of leather culture - **TRUST, HONOUR, STRENGTH, INTEGRITY** - in their fetish lives and carry these values in to their daily lives in a way which empowers them, through community support and accountability.
- To access and celebrate trans joy and gender euphoria, through the lens of leather aesthetics, leather culture, and sexual freedom
- To provide education - both to the wider community on trans issues, and to our members on leather history, culture and practices, amplifying the reach of trans educators within the leather scene
- To build bridges within the leather community through collaboration with other clubs and events
- To take an intersectional approach, recognising the difference in experiences of all further marginalised community members and striving towards an inclusive and equitable leather scene, where all people can find refuge from discrimination.
- To celebrate how diverse and unique the trans experience is, and how this is similar to peopleâ€™s experiences with kink - the club is open to all regardless of transition status or the amount of leather you own.
